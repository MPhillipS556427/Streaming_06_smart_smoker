"""This script is designed to monitor and analyze temperature data received from a RabbitMQ queue named '03-food-B'. 
The script processes temperature readings for a food item (referred to as Food B) and checks for significant temperature fluctuations over a specified time window. 
When temperature changes beyond a certain threshold are detected, an alert is triggered.
