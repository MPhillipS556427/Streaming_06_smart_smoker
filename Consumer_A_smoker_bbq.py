"""This script is designed to monitor and process temperature readings from a RabbitMQ queue, specifically for 'Food A'. 
The temperature data originates from a CSV file and is sent to a RabbitMQ queue, representing the temperature of the specified food item. 
The script establishes a connection to the RabbitMQ server, consumes temperature messages from the 'Food A' queue, and analyzes these readings to detect significant temperature changes over a specific time window.
